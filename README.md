# Olympic-Games-Analysis-SQL-Power-BI
In this project, Olympic Games data is analyzed using SQL and Power BI.

The aim of the project was to query relevant data from obtained dataset and visualize it in such a way that it will help readers understand how countries have performed historically in the summer Olympic Games with the ability to filter using different countries, sports, years, and athletes.

The proposed data was initially entered into a SQL database and then transformed using the necessary query attached. Finally, visualization of the transformed data was performed by using Power BI. The finished dashboard consisted of visualizations and filters that provided users with an easy way to navigate through the Olympic summer games' history. 

The original data can be obtained via the following [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3sxwx52o3x8ozj7/olympic_games.bak?dl=0)
